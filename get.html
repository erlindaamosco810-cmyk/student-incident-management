        <strong>Steps to take:</strong><br>
        1. Talk to the child calmly and listen to their experience. Let them know they are not alone.<br>
        2. Contact the teacher and explain the situation, including specific incidents and times.<br>
        3. Inform the school guidance counselor and principal. Provide any evidence if possible.<br>
        4. If unresolved, contact the Department of Education (DepEd) hotline: 1-800-1-DepEd (1-800-133733) or visit <a class="table-link" href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/resources/" target="_blank">DepEd Resources</a>.<br>
        <em>Bullying affects mental health, confidence, and school performance. Early reporting helps protect the child and encourages a safer school environment.</em><br>

        <strong>Steps to take:</strong><br>
        1. Keep evidence of the bullying (screenshots, messages, emails, posts).<br>
        2. Report the incident to the platform (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, etc.) using their “report abuse” feature.<br>
        3. Contact the <strong>National Center for Cybersecurity Incident Response (NCIRC)</strong> at <a class="table-link" href="https://www.ncirc.gov.ph/" target="_blank">ncirc.gov.ph</a> for guidance.<br>
        4. Teach the child to block or mute the bully, avoid responding aggressively, and share experiences with a trusted adult.<br>
        <em>Cyberbullying can impact mental health and self-esteem. Acting early, documenting incidents, and reporting to authorities are key steps.</em><br>
        <strong>Reminder:</strong> Never let the child face online bullying alone. Emotional support from family and professionals is essential.

        <strong>What to do:</strong><br>
        1. Talk to the school principal or superintendent first and explain the incidents clearly.<br>
        2. If the school does not resolve the issue, contact the DepEd regional office for guidance.<br>
        3. For serious or ongoing harassment, contact the <strong>Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Philippines</strong> at 1343 or visit <a class="table-link" href="https://www.chr.gov.ph/" target="_blank">CHR Official Website</a>.<br>
        <em>CHR can investigate discrimination and harassment cases and ensure schools follow laws protecting students’ rights.</em><br>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep detailed records of all incidents, communications with school officials, and any evidence. Documentation helps in filing formal complaints.
